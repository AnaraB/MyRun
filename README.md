# MyRun
Application to record running or cycling workouts


Project MyRun
This project is the production of an app called ‘MyRun’. This app logs a user’s running activity and stores it in their local storage. 

The app was designed as part of a project work by Aygerim, Eyram, Teddy and Esther on the Front-end web developer bootcamp. The app will be maintained by the collaborators. 

The idea of creating this app came from the need for a reporting app for user's running activity. In the app, the user is presented with the ability to record the running activity that they have undertaken, including the distance covered and the time spent on the activity. In the app, locations are marked with markers on the map. 

The app has a split layout with an interactive map spanning its right side, and a toolbar to its left side. The app shows the date in real time and provides self explanatory information on its usage. 

The app uses 3 icons to depicts the reset, inspirational quotes and weather buttons which provides the user with opportunities to reset the activity entry field, as well as checking the weather in their current location. 
The user also benefits from randomly selected inspirational quotes with the aim of adding colour to their day. The app uses a wide range of colours which has been carefully selected to cheer up the user. 

Upon restart of the app, it asks for consent to use the user’s location. When the user grants consent, they can enjoy the full benefits of the app which includes recognition of their location and the ability to mark their run distance. The app stores the user’s consent to share their location and will re-request the user’s consent if their cache is cleared. 

The app also has an added advantage of the weather feature. It can summarise the weather of any UK location of the user’s choice. The user is presented with the ability to select the location using the weather button. The weather of the chosen location is given in one click. This feature is easy to use and can be extremely beneficial to the user. 


*** User Story *** <br />
As a user, I want to log my running workouts with location, distance and  time, so I can keep a log of all my running  activities. 

As a user, I want to see all my workouts at a glance, so I can easily track my progress over time. 

As a user, I want also see my workouts on a map, so I can easily check where I work out the most.
