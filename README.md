* The app is designed to log a user's running activity and store it in their local storage.
* The app uses three icons for reset, inspirational quotes, and weather functionalities.
* Upon restart, the app requests consent to use the user's location  and allows them to mark their run distance..
* The weather feature of the app can summarize the weather of any location chosen by the user.
* The app provides the user with randomly selected inspirational quotes.
